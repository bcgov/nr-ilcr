/**
 * Sign the user out after {@code timeoutMs} of INACTIVITY (60-minute idle timeout). Amplify keeps the
 * access/id token refreshed while the user is active, so an active session never expires; this adds
 * the idle cap for shared-workstation safety. Only armed when {@code enabled} (an authenticated
 * session).
 *
 * <p>Idleness is measured against a {@code localStorage} timestamp shared by all tabs, not a per-tab
 * timer. That fixes two bugs a bare {@code setTimeout} has: (1) a background tab wouldn't sign out a
 * user actively working in another tab of the same session, and (2) after the laptop sleeps —
 * where {@code setTimeout} does not fire reliably — the next check compares wall-clock elapsed and
 * signs out (or re-arms) correctly instead of trusting a timer that may have stalled.
 *
 * @param onIdle called once when the idle window elapses (e.g. sign out)
 * @param timeoutMs the inactivity window in milliseconds
 * @param enabled arm the timer only when true (e.g. authenticated)
